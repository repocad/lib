/* this is a WIP of a mock-up of our concept for what we call the "Internet of Digital Design" (IDD) .
   Please read through this quick intro:
NAVIGATION: pan and zoom with the mouse center wheel
DRAWING: Currently lines, text, and circles are supported
COMMENTING: anything within dash and * is ignored.
COMPILATION: real-time unless 'stop' is pressed
PRINTING: PDF (A4) currently scale 1:1 is supported
SAVING TO PNG: Right click and choose "save image as..."

#draw a line from (-90,130) to (90,130):
line -90 130 90 130
circle 80 110 10 


#draw a text:
text -35 -126 8 "these lines and curves were generated using loops!"

#The sample scripts below shows how for-loops are used:
for i <- -1 to 3 {
    for j <- 2 to 8 {
        line -90 j * 18 90 i * 27
    }
}

#another loop using bezier curves:
for i <- -1 to 3 {
    for j <- -1 to 3 {
        startX = -90
        startY = j * 18
        control1X = 233
        control1Y = i * 27
        control2X = 33
        control2Y = 177

        bezierCurve startX startY control1X control1Y control2X control2Y -40 j * 9
    }
}
